## Overview
A crappy blackjack game to play in your Terminal if you need a coding break. 

Played with a standard 52-card deck, with replacements. 


## Future feature ideas
* Add functions like Split and Double Down
* Test Ace high/low functionality
* Add high score / game saving
* Render cards better
* Add a card counting counter
* Set round limit so you don't procrastinate for too long
